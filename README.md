### How to Run Code

Our code is built in Jupyter Notebooks meant to run in Google Colab.

We also used Google Earth Engine to extract the Satelite Embeddings V1 data for our specific regions. The Data can be accessed with this link: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/tufts/Tests
It can also be found in the GEE folder in this repository.
GOOGLE_SATELLITE_EMBEDDING_V1_ANNUAL just maps the 2022 GEE embeddings over South Africa.
Test4 is the final version of the code used to extract the Satelite Embeddings V1 data.
ReMap maps both the cleaned pixel based data set as well as the original shapes, allowing a user to see which pixels were removed from those shapes.
In order to run these, run the files in GEE, and make sure the file paths at the top of each match your GEE storage paths.
